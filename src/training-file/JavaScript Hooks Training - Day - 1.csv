question,answer
What are hooks?,Hooks are custom JavaScript functions that allow you to execute code before or after an API request or response.
What do hooks in API enable?,Hooks enable custom JavaScript execution before an API request and after the API provider sends a response.
What are the types of hooks available when creating an element?,There are two types of hooks when creating an element: global hooks and resource hooks.
What is the difference between global hooks and resource hooks?,"Global hooks happen on every request or response, while resource hooks happen only on requests to and responses from specific endpoints."
What can hooks be used for?,Hooks can be used to manipulate any part of a request or response or to operate on a configuration.
In what scenarios might one need a hook?,"One might need a hook due to endpoint authentication, sending a value to an endpoint of a different data type than what Cloud Elements supports, or to manipulate headers to extract an ID to include in a response."
What should be referred to for use cases of hooks?,You can refer to Examples (presumably a section in the original document or website) for more use cases of hooks.
Where can you find more information about hooks?,You can find more information about hooks in the Cloud Elements documentation here https://docs.cloud-elements.com/home/element-builder-setup-hooks
What is a global hook?,A global hook is a custom JavaScript function that applies to all requests or responses configured for an element.
What is a resource hook?,A resource hook is a custom JavaScript function that applies to requests or responses configured for a specific endpoint.
What is a pre-request hook?,A pre-request hook is a custom JavaScript function that executes prior to sending API requests.
What is a post-response hook?,A post-response hook is a custom JavaScript function that executes after receiving a response from an API provider.
What is a javascript hook in Cloud Elements or Integration Service?,"In the context of programming, a hook is a function or a piece of code that is triggered to run either before (pre-hook) or after (post-hook) a specific event, such as an API request or a response. Hooks enable developers to enhance or add functionality to a system without making direct modifications to the system's source code.

JavaScript hooks are used to perform custom processing of data before sending an API request or after receiving an API response. They were used to manipulate headers, request bodies, and response data as well as execute other custom actions based on specific conditions. Different hooks allowed communication with other scripts or services via HTTPS.

The hook's body contains the logic to be executed, and often ends with a call to the done function, which signals the continuation or the end of the process based on the parameters provided to done. For instance, the done function may be called with an object that includes manipulated headers or body to be used in an API request or response.

In some cases, these hooks are used to integrate with third-party services or libraries. Lodash, Util, and HTTPS are examples of JavaScript libraries that may be used within a hook. In some other cases, hooks are used to handle specific request methods like DELETE or alter element configurations.

Overall, JavaScript hooks serve as flexible tools to insert custom code in order to handle, process and manipulate an application's request-response lifecycle."
What is the purpose of the request_body parameter?,The request_body parameter contains the incoming request HTTP body.

What is the purpose of the metadata_merge parameter?,"The metadata_merge parameter is a function that is applicable for the endpoint /objects/{objectName}/metadata. If set to true when vendors support metadata and post hook returns CE format of vendor metadata, it merges the vendorâ€™s metadata with CE model metadata."
What is the purpose of the done parameter?,The done parameter is the callback function that must be called at the end of the JavaScript function.
What is the purpose of the console.log statement?,The console.log statement allows you to log data to the JavaScript console for debugging purposes.
What version of JavaScript is supported in formulas?,ES6 (JavaScript 2015) is supported in hooks.
Can I modify the function parameters directly?,"No, function parameters are immutable and cannot be modified directly. To change an object or value passed into the function, first copy it to your own local variable and then make the necessary changes."
When are body variables applicable?,"Body variables (request_body) are only applicable to methods that pass a JSON body, such as POST, PATCH, and PUT. They are undefined or null if there is no JSON body sent."
How do I add a new line character to a string in the JavaScript editor?,"Since the JavaScript editor in Element Builder parses the \n character and adds a new line, to add a new line character, you must escape the \n by adding an additional slash. For example, the \n character would be entered as \\n."
What is the purpose of the done function?,The done function is a callback function that must be called at the end of the JavaScript function to indicate that the function has finished executing.
What can the done function pass as an argument?,The done function can pass a continue object as an argument. This object indicates that the API request should continue to be processed and that any new objects should overwrite the existing incoming objects to this function.
What happens if the done function is not called?,"If the done function is not called, the JavaScript function will continue to execute indefinitely. This can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior."
When should the done function be called?,"The done function should be called after all the necessary processing has been completed. This may include tasks such as manipulating the request or response, accessing the metadata, or calling other functions."
What is the purpose of the continue object?,The continue object is used to indicate that the API request should continue to be processed. It can also be used to overwrite the existing incoming objects with new objects.
Give an example of calling done function,"`javascript\n//Calling done function with continue\ndone({\ncontinue: true,\nrequest_vendor_parameters: new_request_vendor_parameters\n});`"
What is the purpose of the done function in this context?,The done function is used to signal that the JavaScript function has finished executing and to provide additional information about how the API request should be processed.
What does the continue property in the done function indicate?,"The continue property indicates whether or not the API request should continue to be processed. If set to true, the request will continue; if set to false, the request will be stopped."
What does the request_vendor_parameters property in the done function do?,The request_vendor_parameters property is used to overwrite the existing request vendor parameters with new parameters. These new parameters will be used when sending the request to the vendor.
In what situations would you use a continue value of false in a pre-hook?,You would use a continue value of false in a pre-hook if you want to stop the execution of the API request at that point and return a response. This can be useful for customizing a response or handling errors.
What happens if a request has a postHook when you send a continue value of false in a pre-hook?,"If a request has a postHook, it will be executed before the response is returned. This allows you to further customize the response before it is sent to the client."
What is the role of the done function in a hook?,"The done function is a callback that should be called to end the function. It can pass a continue object, indicating that the API request should continue to be processed, and any new objects that should overwrite the existing incoming objects."
What does the object passed to the done function indicate?,"The object passed to the done function can contain a 'continue' value, which when true, indicates that the API request should continue to be processed, and 'request_vendor_parameters', which will overwrite the existing request vendor parameters."
What happens if false is sent as the 'continue' value in a pre-hook?,"If false is sent as the 'continue' value in a pre-hook, the execution stops at this point and returns the response. If the request has a postHook, then it will execute that before returning. This can be used to further customize a response."
What does the 'request_vendor_parameters' key in the done function's object represent?,"In the given example, the 'request_vendor_parameters' returned will overwrite the request vendor parameters that need to be sent to the endpoint."
Can you provide an example of how the done function can be used in a hook?,"Sure, let's say we have new parameters ready to overwrite the existing vendor-specific request parameters. An example use of done function would look something like this: javascript done({ ""continue"": true, ""request_vendor_parameters"": new_request_vendor_parameters }); In this example, continue being true indicates the API request should continue to be processed. The new request_vendor_parameters will overwrite the existing ones that are due to be sent to the endpoint."
